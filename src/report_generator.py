"""
Turns (predicted condition, confidence, Grad-CAM region) into a readable
report. Tries retrieval from real OpenI report text first (if the index
exists); falls back to a clean template if the index isn't built yet or
nothing relevant is found. Always keep the template fallback -- it's what
guarantees the demo works even if the retrieval index has issues.
