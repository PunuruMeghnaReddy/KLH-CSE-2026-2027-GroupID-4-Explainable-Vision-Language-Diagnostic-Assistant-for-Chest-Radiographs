Rule-based urgency scoring. Deliberately NOT a learned model -- triage
decisions need to be auditable and explainable to clinical staff, and a
simple rule table is easier to validate with a clinician than a black box.

Adjust SEVERITY and the thresholds below in consultation with whatever
clinical guidance you have access to for the project; the values here are
placeholders for demo purposes, not vetted medical thresholds.
